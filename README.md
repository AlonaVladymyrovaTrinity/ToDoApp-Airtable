# React-Airtable Todo App

This is a simple Todo app built with React and Airtable, designed to help you keep track of your tasks and to-dos. You can add new tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them as needed.

## Getting Started

To get started with this app, you'll need to do a few things:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Create a new Airtable account if you don't already have one
3. Create a new Airtable base for your tasks
4. Update the `.env` file with your Airtable API key and base ID

Once you've done that, you can run the app locally using the following commands:

```
npm install

This will start a development server at `http://localhost:3000/` where you can view and interact with the app.
